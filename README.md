# SilverStripe SimpleSEO

A simple SilverStripe SEO module offering easy to understand tips for CMS users, and a live-update to show them how their site might look in search engine results. The goal of this module is to guide content authors and show them how editing metadata will impact search engine result pages, rather than offering a Swiss Army knife for advanced users to tweak everything.
